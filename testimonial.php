							<p>“Mandy did a fantastic job, spending time in preliminary 
							meetings listening carefully to what I wanted, providing ideas 
							and then producing a book which surpassed all of my expectations. 
							Highly recommend her to anyone wishing to capture their memories 
							in a book or provide a memorable gift.” </p>

							<p>"After sifting through the hundreds of random pictures I 
							sent of my then six-month old son, Mandy was able to choose 
							all of the best shots that really captured who he was. Then, 
							she creatively grouped those shots together and meticulously 
							decorated each scrapbook page with a theme that suited those 
							hand chosen pictures perfectly. I couldn't be happier with the 
							product I received and whenever I have the opportunity to share 
							the scrapbook with friends and family, they always marvel at 
							what a special creation it is. I am truly grateful to have our 
							precious memories captured in such a one-of-a kind way! Thanks 
							again and look forward to purchasing another product soon."</p>

							<p>“Working with Mandy is always such a pleasure. She has excellent 
							ideas and suggestions that are unique and personal to each occasion. 
							Her exclusive items are the perfect keepsake and reminder of 
							wonderful memories. The shadow box that she made is a reminder 
							of the cherished days between my husband and me. The quality, 
							colors, and presentation are all perfect and it will be displayed 
							in our home for many years to come. I know that when I request 
							Mandy to create an item, whether for myself or a loved one, 
							I will never be let down. She is my go to person for all future 
							occasions ~ a true professional in every way!”</p>

							<p>"Mandy created me a one-of-a-kind piece for my new home. 
							She used her creative eye to put together a sweet shadowbox 
							that is artfully layered. It is displayed in my foyer - the 
							first thing people see when they enter the house - and I could 
							not be happier with the impression it makes. Mandy also creates 
							scrapbooks and loose scrapbook pages. Her style is detailed 
							yet clean. She will get inspired by a simple photograph and 
							uses a variety of papers and textiles to turn them into works 
							of art."</p>

							<p>“I have a lot of photos and sentimental items collected over 
							the years; most of them are either in an album or in a box. 
							The ones that were in an album sometimes had a hand-written 
							caption so I wouldn’t forget who or what the photo was about. 
							There was nothing “extraordinary” about the photos in the album 
							if they made it into the album in the first place. All of that 
							changed when Mandy introduced the idea of scrapbooking my photos 
							for me to make the memories more vibrant and more than just 
							another photo. She took the time to understand what I wanted 
							to be included in my scrapbook, selecting the photos and sentiments 
							that captured all the precious moments for me, all the while 
							enhancing each page with an artistic flare that had me reliving 
							each memory as if it happened yesterday.”</p>

							<p>“Mandy has the unique and incredibly special gift of creating 
							scrapbooks that so vividly express emotion through words, pictures, 
							and artwork. The shadow box Mandy created hangs on a wall in 
							my office, coaxing a smile out of me even on the toughest days. 
							I can't think of a better way to say "I love you" than a handmade 
							creation from Mandy.”</p>
